```{r setup, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE) #, knitr.table.format = 'latex')
options(width=45)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.pos = 'H')
library(knitr)
# Check to see if here package is loaded to prevent problems with rendering from the
# console or from a script (e.g. _make.R)
if(!("here" %in% (.packages()))){
  library(here)
  here()
}
rdir <- paste0(here(), "/..")
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = rdir, base.dir = rdir)
```

## Be Brave and Experiment 

Making mistakes and experimenting is an essential part of learning R.
You can recover from most mistakes (e.g. by restarting R). To do this 
"safely" start with a *fresh* R session without any other data loaded 
(otherwise you could lose it). 

  `r here()`

## Getting Started with the Exercises

After unzipping the downloaded file Navigate to `Share\Exercises` and double 
click on `CW-Summary.Rproj` which should automatically open RStudio (with the
right set up for you to do the exercises).

## Objective

The key objective is for you to create an R Markdown file (`.Rmd`) to recreate the 
following documents:

1. CW-Report-Target-HTML.html
2. CW-Report-Target-prettydoc.html
3. CW-Slides-Target.html
4. CW-Report-Target-PDF.pdf

## Copy and Paste

It is perfectly fine to copy and paste from the target file into your `.Rmd` files. 
The objective for you to understand the thinking behind R Markdown.

## Chick Weight Data

The example presented in the target documents is based on R's Chick Weight 
(`ChickWeight`) data. Read through the first document to understand the example.

## Install Packages

Before you start the exercises please install the following packages if you do not
have them installed.

```{r installpkgs, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("prettydoc")
install.packages("kableExtra")
install.packages("rticles")
```

## LaTeX (TeX) 

To create PDF documents you need to have LaTeX installed. If you do not have it installed
you can install through R using the following commands:
```{r installLaTeX, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```


## Exercise 1 

The objective of this exercise is to recreate `CW-Report-Target-HTML.html` in your 
`Exercises` folder.

```{r CW-Report-Target-HTML, out.width="3.4in", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="\\label{fig:CW-HTML}CW-Report-Target-HTML.html", echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("Exercises", "images", "CW-Report-Target-HTML.png"))
```

Create a new R Markdown `HTML` document and save it as `My-Report-Target-HTML.Rmd`:

```{r New-R-Markdown-HTML, out.width="3.0in", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="\\label{fig:Rmd-HTML}New R Markdown HTML document", echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("Exercises", "images", "New-R-Markdown-HTML.png"))
```

## Navigation Side Bar

To get the orange themed navigation system use the following as your `YAML` header.
The indentation is very **important**!

```
---
title: "Chick Weight Report - Target"
author: "Your Name Here!"
date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%a %d %b %Y (%H:%M:%S)')`"
output:
  html_document:
    theme: united
    highlight: tango
    toc: yes
    toc_depth: 3
    toc_float:
      collapsed: no
      smooth_scroll: no
---
```

### Themes & Highlights

Try experimenting with different `theme` and `highlight` settings in the `YAML` 
header. Keep the one you like.

+ `theme` options: `default`, `cerulean`, `journal`, `flatly`, `darkly`, `readable`, 
`spacelab`, united, `cosmo`, lumen, `paper`, `sandstone`, `simplex` and `yeti`.
+ `highlight` options: `default`, `tango`, `pygments`, `kate`, `monochrome`, `espresso`, 
`zenburn`, `haddock`, `breezedark` and `textmate`.

## Exercise 2

The objective of this exercise is to recreate `CW-Report-Target-prettydoc.html`:

```{r CW-Report-Target-prettydoc, out.width="3.4in", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="\\label{fig:CW-prettydoc}CW-Report-Target-prettydoc.html", echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("Exercises", "images", "CW-Report-Target-prettydoc.png"))
```

### First install `prettydoc` package

```{r install-prettydoc, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
```

Create a new R Markdown `prettydoc` document `From Template` and save it as `My-Report-Target-prettydoc.Rmd` in your `Exercises` folder.

```{r New-R-Markdown-prettydoc, out.width="3.0in", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="\\label{fig:Rmd-prettydoc}New R Markdown `prettydoc` document", echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("Exercises", "images", "New-R-Markdown-prettydoc.png"))
```

### Themes & Highlights

Try experimenting with different `prettydoc` themes and `highlight` settings in the `YAML` 
header. Keep the one you like.

+ `theme` options: `architect`, `cayman`, `hpstr`, `leonids` and `tactile`.

## Exercise 3 

The objective of this exercise is to recreate `CW-Slides-Target.html`:

```{r CW-Slides-Target, out.width="3.4in", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="\\label{fig:CW-Slides-Target-fig}CW-Slides-Target.html", echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("Exercises", "images", "CW-Slides-Target.png"))
```

Create a new `ioslide` R Markdown document from `Presentation` and save it as `My-Slides-Target.Rmd` in your `Exercises` folder.

```{r New-R-Markdown-Slides, out.width="3.0in", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="\\label{fig:Rmd-slides}New R Markdown `ioslide` HTML presentation", echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("Exercises", "images", "New-R-Markdown-Slides.png"))
```


## Exercise 4 

The objective of this exercise is to recreate `CW-Report-Target-PDF.pdf`:

```{r CW-Report-Target-PDF, out.width="3.1in", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="\\label{fig:CW-Report-Target-PDF-fig}CW-Report-Target-PDF.html", echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("Exercises", "images", "CW-Report-Target-PDF.png"))
```

Create a new R Markdown `PDF` document and save it as `My-Report-Target-PDF.Rmd`:

```{r New-R-Markdown-PDF, out.width="3.0in", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="\\label{fig:Rmd-PDF}New R Markdown PDF document", echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("Exercises", "images", "New-R-Markdown-PDF.png"))
```

## Table of Contents

To include a table of contents use the following as your `YAML` header.
